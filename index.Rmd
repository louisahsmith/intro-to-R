## RStudio tips and tricks

The font you saw in my RStudio is Fira Code. Instructions to install can be found [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/RStudio-instructions).

Beyond the themes that come pre-installed with RStudio, there are a variety of others available with the `rsthemes` package [here](https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes).

You can also make your own theme! There's more information in [this article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011846747-Using-RStudio-Themes).

If you use certain headers like `# ----` in your code, your code sections will be automatically labeled and you can use the outline viewer (the rightmost button direct above your script) or the section selector (bottom left of the script section). Read more [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484568-Code-Folding-and-Sections).
